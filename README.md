# NLP_search_algorithm_information_retrieval

Welcome to the Proof of Concept (POC) Machine Learning System designed to showcase our Natural Language Processing (NLP) search algorithm. This system allows you to predict and evaluate search results in a user-friendly manner. Follow the steps below to set up and run the system locally.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (recommended version 3.6 or higher)
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)

### Step 1: Download the Repository

Start by downloading the project's "app" folder to your local machine. You can do this by cloning the GitHub repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

### Step 2: Run the POC ML System

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Change the working directory to the "app" folder, where you downloaded the project:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/app/folder
```

3. Ensure you have the Uvicorn package installed. If you haven't already installed it, you can do so using pip:

```sh
pip install uvicorn
```

4. Start the POC ML system by running the following command:

```sh
uvicorn app:app
```

This command initiates the local server for the POC ML system.

### Step 3: Access the Swagger UI

1. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome).

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs]
You will be greeted by the Swagger UI, which provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API.

## Usage

Explore the API documentation within the Swagger UI to understand the available endpoints and make use of the NLP search algorithm.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help us improve this POC ML system.
