    "### Case Background and Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch Rewards is a mobile app that rewards users for scanning and uploading shopping receipts,\n",
    "and allows users to earn points for gift cards—a rewarding way to shop\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Fetch wants to develop an effective tool for users to search for offers easily, so as to maximize\n",
    "app usage and enhance partner relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool should return a list of relevant offers when a user searches for a category/brand/retailer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool should return the score used to measure the similarity of text\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool is expected to provide a good user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: Information retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Input & Output: User query & A list of offers highly relevant to user’s query\n",
    "\n",
    "Database: Three dataset comprising categories, brands, retailers, and associated offers\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Given user query and database, retrieve and present the top 'k' offers that are most\n",
    "relevant to the user's query\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline: Core Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question is how to build an effective retriever when working with a database of entries.\n",
    "Typically, two solutions are considered for the Information Retrieval (IR) task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. BM 25 Frequency-based Retriever \n",
    "##### Pros : \n",
    "a. BM25 is computationally efficient (no training needed) and scales well for a mobile app\n",
    "       environment with potentially large datasets\n",
    "       \n",
    "b. It can be effective for simple search tasks, such as category, brand, or retailer lookup\n",
    "##### Cons : \n",
    "a. BM25 does not consider the semantic meaning or context of the user query, which may\n",
    "       result in suboptimal ranking, so the algorithm might not select the potential offers that\n",
    "       best fit with users’ query\n",
    "       \n",
    "b. BM25 does not adapt to changing user behavior or preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Neural Retriever (SentenceTransformer): \n",
    "##### Pros : \n",
    "a. Better performance on information retrieval benchmark, which is to say, the potential\n",
    "       offers that returned to the user will be more accurate\n",
    "       \n",
    "b. Align well with user intent by capturing complex semantic relationships between queries,\n",
    "       which will generate relevant and context-aware potential offers relevant to the user\n",
    "       queries\n",
    "##### Cons : \n",
    "a. Rely on large amounts of labeled data for training, and the availability of such data for\n",
    "       specific retail domains and offer categories may vary, affecting the performance of the\n",
    "       algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Solution Retriever: \n",
    "I chose Neural Retriever as the solution method, for 1) Its better performance to understand user’s\n",
    "query 2) Its limitation can be avoided by using pre-trained models. \n",
    "To further improve the performance, I chose to deploy a rerank algorithm for the retrieved offers,\n",
    "to better adapt to complex semantic search situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline: User-friendly Features\n",
    "_User Scenario 1 : User Query with Typo_\n",
    "Suppose a user enters his query with typos (e.g., ’targt’ instead of ‘target’), how to ensure the tool\n",
    "could identify the actual query?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_App Feature 1_** : _Ngram Fuzzy Search_\n",
    "Before encoding, I chose Ngram fuzzy search to understand the user query, which involves\n",
    "matching the user's query with relevant terms in the dataset. This process efficiently corrects typos\n",
    "and enhances search accuracy and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "_User Scenario 2 : Lengthy Offer Output_\n",
    "Suppose a user enters their query, then a lengthy result is presented to him (e.g., for the brand\n",
    "prego, the retailer is mcalisters deli, the product category is red pasta sauce, which belongs to\n",
    "parent category pasta sauce, now the offer is...).\n",
    "How can we make this offer output more readable and user-friendly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_App Feature 2 :_** _Design User-friendly Results Presentation Formats_\n",
    "Different from the lengthy string used for algorithmic processing, I created a user-friendly output\n",
    "string to provide users with a quick and informative overview of offers, significantly enhancing their\n",
    "app experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Appendix: Technical Specifications\n",
    "#### 1. Character-level Matching (Ngram Fuzzy Search) \n",
    "a. Ngram Similarity Calculation\n",
    "Begin by calculating character-level similarity between the user’s typo query and potential actual queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Threshold-Based Filtering\n",
    "Next, filter out potential queries that fall below a defined threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Top-K Potential Queries\n",
    "Finally, return the top-K potential queries based on their similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. SentenceTransformer \n",
    "a. Semantic Representation\n",
    "Begin by converting database entries and user query into vectorized representations using SentenceTransformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Bi-Encoder to Retrieve\n",
    "Next, use bi-encoder to calculate cosine similarity scores between representations of query and available offers, then retrieves a list of potentially offers relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Cross-Encoder to Rerank\n",
    "Finally, use cross-encoder to score the retrieved offers within the context of the query, then generate the ultimate search results."
